                <p class="title">Me and I</p>
                <p>A photographic exploration of one woman’s relationship with Judaism.

I grew up in Arizona in a reform Jewish household in a Reform Jewish community. I attended a Reform synagogue, and learned how to be a Reform Jew. While I was taught the customs and traditions of other sects of Judaism, I rarely ever got to see them for myself in this liberal context. 
When I moved across the country to Boston, I was surprised to find the lack of a strong Reform Jewish community. My research showed me that there were only two synagogues in the area with Reform services, and that they were held only occasionally, in a part of the city that would have been difficult for me to get to on my own. So I joined the Orthodox and Conservative Jews on my small college campus, and began going to Orthodox services at Chabad. 
For the first time ever, I was at a service where men and women could not sit together. Women could not read from the Torah, or lead in prayer. Unmarried men and women do not touch each other. I observed how different the Jewish culture at Chabad is from the culture I grew up in. All of the lessons I had learned at synagogue suddenly became real. Despite all the differences in this community, it is still a community, and it has very quickly become my own community. 
This photo series began as an experiment for me to understand how I view different kinds of Jewish women. It should be clarified that these images do not represent women who practice Judaism any more or less than the other, or any better or worse than the other. Instead, these images are meant to depict some of the most basic differences that I have seen in Jewish women everywhere, depending on how they choose to practice their religion. 
At the beginning of this project, I hoped that I would be able to end the series with a photo of how I define myself as a Jew. But through the process of this experiment I quickly realized that there are parts of myself in all of the women in these images, and there are parts of all of those women in me.</p>
