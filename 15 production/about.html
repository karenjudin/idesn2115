            <p>About Me</p>
            <p>My name is Karen Judin and I am an aspiring photojournalist. I am a third-year candidate for a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Photography at Lesley University College of Art and Design in Cambridge, Massachusetts. I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona, and throughout my childhood often found myself inspired by the incredible landscapes that were seen daily. I combined this love of nature with my love of art, and early in my life discovered my love for photography. Not only do I love to photograph landscapes, but people in their natural setting. I hope to travel across the globe learning about many different cultures and lifestyles, and making it possible for others to gain awareness.
